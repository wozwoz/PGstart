Electronic authorisations need to be submitted on              <a href=\"https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov\">https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov</a> no less than 72 hours prior to travel. However last minute authorisations can be submitted at the above website. Once approved the electronic travel authorisation will be valid for 2 years or until your passport expires if within the 2 years. Each traveller is responsible for holding the correct documents for their own travel. Beginning 8 September 8 2010, a US$14 fee will be charged for processing ESTA applications. This fee is payable at the time of application, and directly to the U.S. government. The U.S. Government does not support the use of third party vendors for the purpose of applying for ESTA, and recommends that you do not pay a third party vendor to apply on your behalf as accuracy of data cannot be verified. All payments for ESTA applications and renewals must be made by credit card or debit card when applying for or renewing an ESTA.&nbsp; American Express can not be held liable for travellers not holding the correct documentation. Due to US border changes, each foreign visitor between 14 and 79 years of age will be required to have their fingerprints and photograph taken digitally upon arrival at a US port by the immigration authorities.         </li>\n\t\t         <li>\n\t\t\t             <strong>APIS:</strong> (Advanced Passenger Information System) Customs in some countries require additional details not contained on your passport, including             <br />\n\t\t\tpassengers&rsquo; country of residence and full destination address alternatively the first hotel night in those countries.
